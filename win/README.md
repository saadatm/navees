`navees.klc` contains the mappings for Navees. Note, however, that this file _cannot_ be used to create an installable package using [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339) (MSKLC). This is because Navees maps the character `ZWNJ` (U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER) on `Shift`+`Space`, and for some reason, MSKLC does not allow it. Initially, I had patched the MSKLC binary to override this behaviour, but the installable package built by that patched binary was being blocked by Windows 10.

I am now using [KbdEdit Premium](http://www.kbdedit.com/) to build an installer for Navees. KbdEdit can import a .klc file, so I shall keep using `navees.klc` as the source.
